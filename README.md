**Mental Health Sentiment Analysis**

This project implements an end-to-end mental health sentiment analysis system using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The system classifies text into mental-health-related categories and assigns a confidence score and risk level to each prediction. The project is designed for academic and research purposes and demonstrates the full pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment.

Disclaimer: This project is intended strictly for educational and research use. It is not a diagnostic or clinical tool.

**Project Objectives**

Analyze mental health–related text data

Classify text into predefined mental health categories

Provide confidence scores for predictions

Assign risk levels based on prediction confidence and category

Demonstrate real-time inference using a backend API and frontend interface

**Mental Health Categories**

The model predicts the following classes:

depression

anxiety

stress

suicidal

normal

bipolar

ptsd

Each prediction includes a probability score and a derived risk level.

**Technology Stack**

Python 3

PyTorch

Hugging Face Transformers (DistilBERT)

FastAPI

Uvicorn

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Scikit-learn (baseline models)

**Model Details**

Baseline Model: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression

Deep Learning Model: DistilBERT

Task: Multi-class text classification

Fine-tuning: Domain-specific mental health text

Output: Predicted label with confidence score

**Risk Level Assignment**

Risk levels are determined using rule-based logic combining prediction confidence and predicted class.

**Condition**	                                      **Risk Level**
Suicidal content with high confidence	                 High
Mental health class with high confidence	             High
Mental health class with medium confidence	             Medium
Normal or low-confidence prediction	                     Low

This design prioritizes safety-aware interpretation.

**Backend API (FastAPI)**
Start the server
cd api
uvicorn app:app --reload


The API runs at:

http://127.0.0.1:8000


API documentation is available at:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

**Example API Request**

POST /predict

{
  "text": "I feel overwhelmed and anxious most days"
}


Example response:

{
  "prediction": "anxiety",
  "confidence": 0.998,
  "risk_level": "High"
}

**Frontend**

Start the FastAPI backend

Open the following file in a browser:

frontend/index.html


The frontend allows users to input text and view predictions, confidence scores, and risk levels.

**Model Files and Version Control**

Trained model files are large and are excluded from version control using .gitignore.

To run the project locally:

Ensure model files are present inside the models/ directory

Update model paths in api/app.py if required

This follows standard machine learning best practices.

**Evaluation Summary**

Baseline and deep learning models were evaluated

DistilBERT outperformed traditional models on contextual understanding

The system supports real-time inference

Designed with ethical and reproducibility considerations

**Ethical Considerations**

No personally identifiable information is used

Data is treated as publicly available text

Clear disclaimer included

The system is not intended for clinical or diagnostic use
